Build a cloud storage based file system (I)
======================================

After Baidu limiting the download speed of its cloud drive [Baidu Cloud](http://pan.baidu.com), the last free cloud drive in mainland China becomes de facto usable. One can unlock the download limitation by getting a so called **super** membership. That's 298 Yuan a year. Well, I have to say it's quite a fear deal, but I'm thinking with 298 Yuan a year, I can build it myself.

There are several cloud service providers in China, they have great cloud storage products. And I choose [Aliyun](http://aliyun.com) OSS at the end, since it's most widely used and trusted.

## Estimate the cost
Fist I have to estimate the monthly cost.
* I have ~200GB data.
* I visit my data infrequently, let's say 10GB per month.

Aliyun provides storage type of "infrequently visited data", which is perfect for my case

|Fee| Price|
|-------|-------------|
|Storage | 0.08 Yuan/GB|
|Getting data back |0.0325 Yuan/GB |
|Data transferred out of Aliyun | 0.50 Yuan/GB |

**Monthly cost** = 200 \* 0.08 + 10 \* 0.032 + 0.50 \* 10 = 21.32

And I can expect a discount of ~80% from Aliyun  

**Estimated Annual cost** = 21.32 \* 12 \* 0.8 = 204.672

## Define requirements
* I want to access my data from my mac laptop and linux VPS, and a mountable file system like [s3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) is preferred.
* For well-known reasons, Aliyun may censor my data, so an encryption layer is a must.
* I'm the only user of this file system, so race condition (like read & write at the same time) is not a concern.
* I want to get my data as quickly as possible, so I have to do some acceleration like prefetch & multiple threading.
* I have to pay for every byte from Aliyun, so I'd better cache the data locally to reduce the total cost, it's also good for accelerate the reading.
* Random read is rare, and random write almost never happens, so I don't really care about `fseek`.
